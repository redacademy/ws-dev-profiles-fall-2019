     <h2 class="sub-heading">About Me</h2>
     <p>Before I came to Vancouver, I worked as the Regional Sales and Marketing Manager for a Manufacturing company in Melbourne.</br>
     I enjoy hiking, travel, music, reading, and going to the gym. I have recently started to learn French, and I hope I will be able to speak French fluently one day.</p>

     <h2 class="sub-heading">My Future Plan</h2>
     <p>I would like to become experienced in web delevelopment, and find a job where I can use my sales and marketing skills 
     together with the knowledge I will learn from this course.   </p>
