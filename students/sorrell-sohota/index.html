	<p>My name is Sorrell and I am from Nottingham, England. I moved to Canada back in 2017 on a working holiday visa. I came straight to Vancouver and fell in love with the city instantly.<br><br>In my free time, I get out and explore Vancouver as much as possible or i am making music. I get lost in music frequently and going on a hike or walking by the beach often gives me a new refreshed state of mind.<br><br>I like to travel as much as possible, adding web developing skills to my itinerary can make my future travel endeavors easier and more obtainable (Working remotely)

	<p>I like the idea of being able to create your own website and actually understand what does what and why. Being able to reach anybody, anywhere is amazing.
