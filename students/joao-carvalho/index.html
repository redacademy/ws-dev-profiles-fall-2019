            <h2>My Hometown</h2>
            <p>
                I'm from a city in Brazil named Aracaju and it's located in Sergipe state, at NorthEast. It's not a big town but it's not exactly small, we have a lot of restaurants, beachs, bars (that me call "botecos"). We also have one of the best foods in the world!
                Some like cuscuz, caranguejo, pastel, feijoada, açaí, acarajé, amendoim and so many others! The city is called this way in honor of a bird called Arara and a fruit call Caju.

            <h2>Life before RED</h2>
            <p>
                Before comming to Vancouver and start the web development program I studied a few things in Aracaju. In 2017 started the Electrical Engineering program at Tiradentes University, but only did 1 year of it. In 2018 I started the Computer Science course
                at Tiradentes University and Applied and Computacional Mathematics at Sergipe Federal University. But I wasn't happy with the quallity of life that I had, so I started to look for web development programs and found RED.

            <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In 2015 I went to Boston with my best friend to play at Nike Basketball Camp. That was the best experience, not only because I played with people from all arround the worl, but because I had the oportunite to develop myself personally AND atleticly. I
                took care of my things, did my duties and enjoyed myself. It was a pretty good summer.

            <p>
                I'm a huge basketball fan! Since I was arround 6, this sport have been on my life every single day, and there is nothing that make me happy than hit 3 points. I've played por the university team, state team, and even played on city championchips.

            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My priority is learn as much as I can from the Web and APP development and apply my new skills on the market, also want to learn from others students and teach what I can. After RED my plans are to apply to a Computer Science course on UBC.
