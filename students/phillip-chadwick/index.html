        <h2>The Birthplace Of Awesome</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised a hop, skip, and a jump from Vancouver in a town called Maple Ridge.<br>
            Tourism highlights include:
            <div class="alist">
            <ul>
                <li>The Billy Miner Pub</li>
                <li>The ACT theater</li>
                <li>The birthplace of yours truly ;)</li>

        <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
        <p>I've had quite a few careers over the course of my life.<br>
        When I was very young I was a Postal Worker for Canada Post. Wanting something<br>
        more exciting I uprooted my life and moved to Alberta to start an electrical apprenticeship.<br>
        Unfortunately before I could obtain my Red Seal I had to return to the west coast<br>
        to be closer to family<br>
        During this period I decided to pursue a career as a hairdresser but it was not the career for me.<br>
        After a few years I decided to return to my previous career as an Electrician, finished<br>
        my apprenticeship, and acquired my Red Seal.<br>
        Fast forward a few more years. Oil prices drop and I decide it is not longer tenable<br>
        to work for the oil sands. Looking for a new challenged I joined Iatse 891 and began<br>
        working on films and TV shows as a lighting technician and a Board Operator.<br>
        To see a body of my work, you can <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8423393/">check out my IMDB page</a>.<br>
        During the filming of Van Helsing I, unfortunately, managed to break my knee rather severely.<br>
        As a result, WCB has agreed to send me through this program where I intend to add <br>
        another high paying career to my resume.

        <h2>What makes me so gosh darn interesting?</h2>
        <p>This is a question only you can answer. Personally, I think my most interesting trait<br>
        is my propensity to make things. I love working with wood, fabric, foam, and other materials<br>
         to make something new</p>
         </div>
         <div class="main d">
        <h2>Experiences Abroad</h2>
        <p>Perhaps my most memorable travel experience would be my time in New Orleans.<br>
        It's was late, so me and my 2 buddies were having a drink at a mutual friends bar<br>
        while we were deciding where we could get a tattoo in the frenh quarter.<br>
        One of the regulars drinking alone at the end of the bar tells us he has all his equipment<br>
        in the back of his car and if we want, he'll tattoo each of us right there in the bar.<br>
        several drinks, and a painful hour later I had a new, voodoo doll, inked onto my arm 
        </p>

        <h2>My secret talent</h2>
        <p>Is not so secret. I am a big fan of videogames and after years of struggle and hardship<br>
        I have become a master of the art.... Basically i'm really good at videogames because I've <br>
        played a lot of them.. 
    </p>

<div class="main f">
        <h2>What could possibly come next?</h2>
        <p>
        My intention is to take the skills I acquire during my time at RedAcademy to establish myself<br>
        within the industry. After all my research leading up to choosing this program one thing kept<br>
        coming up. School gives you the foundation. Working on projects makes you hirable.<br>
        I intend to return to my previous earning potential as quick as possible with a combination of hard<br>
         work and good old fashioned Moxy.

        <h2>The outro</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading this far, hopefully it was at least a little entertaining. I really <br>
        am excited to be starting this program and I look forward to working with all of you!
